Match candidates based on skills, education level, and proximity to the villages.\\n   - **Outcome:** Ensured each village has access to qualified part-time teachers.\\n\\n2. **Training:**\\n   - **Strategy:** Suggest interactive teaching methods suitable for rural settings with limited resources. Focus on basic mathematics, language teaching in multilingual contexts, science teaching with minimal resources, and effective methods for mixed-age classrooms.\\n   - **Outcome:** Provided practical and engaging teaching methods for teachers, ensuring a positive learning experience for students.\\n\\n3. **Incentives:**\\n   - **Strategy:** Match newly recruited part-time teachers with appropriate non-monetary incentives such as farming tools, ration kits, school supplies, and scholarships.\\n   - **Outcome:** Ensured fair and equitable distribution of incentives, motivating and supporting teachers.\\n\\n4. **Community Engagement:**\\n   - **Strategy:** Organize community meetings to gather feedback from parents, promote parental involvement, and address community concerns.\\n   - **Outcome:** Built a strong partnership between the community and the educational program, ensuring its success and sustainability.\\n\\n5. **Progress Tracking:**\\n   - **Strategy:** Track student attendance, learning outcomes, and program growth. Identify trends, success stories, and areas needing improvement.\\n   - **Outcome:** Created comprehensive progress reports for stakeholders, suggesting targeted interventions for improvement.\\n\\n**Challenges:**\\n- **Data Analysis:** The task of analyzing data to identify trends, success stories, and areas needing improvement in the new district was not solvable due to a lack of tools.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\nThe expansion plan was successfully implemented in most areas, with effective recruitment, training, incentives, community engagement, and progress tracking strategies.
